# Automated-Derivative-Calculator-for-Laplace-Dirichlet-Eigenvalues-using-Racket
Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus, and software such as Wolfram Alpha, Mathway, and Symbolab are widely used to calculate them. The Calculus of Moving Surfaces (CMS) is a specialized calculus that applies to surfaces that change shape over time. This is useful in boundary variation problems. One such problem is the Laplace Dirichlet-Eigenvalue Problem that is of importance to researchers studying the eigenvalues of various surfaces. The higher-order variations of this problem provide greater accuracy and additional quantitative results. This problem has remained largely intractable for hand calculations due to complexity and exponential increase in the number of terms in the expression. We have tried to advance the solution to this problem through automation. Using the programming language Racket, we have created an algebraic simplification system that generates a database of derivatives related to this problem. The program applies a set of rules through recursive symbolic coding on the expression to further calculate higher variations. The generated database will allow the researchers to look up expressions instead of calculating by hand and will facilitate further research.
